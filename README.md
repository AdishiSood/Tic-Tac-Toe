# Tic Tac Toe

## What Are We Building?

By inspecting the code, you’ll notice that we have three React components:

Square
Board
Game
The Square component renders a single <button> and the Board renders 9 squares. The Game component renders a board with placeholder values which we’ll modify later. There are currently no interactive components.
