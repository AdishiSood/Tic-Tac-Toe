# Tic Tac Toe

## What Are We Building?
You can see what we’ll be building here: [Final Result](https://codepen.io/adishisood/full/poRZmVp). If the code doesn’t make sense to you, or if you are unfamiliar with the code’s syntax, don’t worry! The goal of this project is to help you understand React and its syntax.

By inspecting the code, you’ll notice that we have three React components:

- Square
- Board
- Game

The Square component renders a single < button > and the Board renders 9 squares. The Game component renders a board with placeholder values which we’ll modify later. There are currently no interactive components.

## Wrapping Up
 Created a tic-tac-toe game that:

- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
